While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the Metro bundler would randomly crash without any clear error message. This would happen intermittently during development, making it difficult to reliably build and test my application.  The crash would manifest as the bundler process terminating unexpectedly, leaving me with a blank terminal and no helpful error logs. This was particularly frustrating as there were no obvious patterns to the crashes; they occurred seemingly at random, regardless of the code changes I made.
